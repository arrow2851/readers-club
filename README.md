About

ReadersClub is an app specific for OracleReadersClub.

The members registered with this app can upload the photos of the covers of books they possess.
Each book will have its own status like InPossession, Lent (to), Borrowed (from), Reading, Finished.

This list will be visible to all other members of the club. They can request to borrow the book from the owner. 

The lender and the borrower are responsible for the status of the book.

Additionally, the owner can put tags to books for easier search for members.
